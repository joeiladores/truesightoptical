        <h2>Adult Eye Exams</h2>
        <p>We will evaluate your vision ( and possible need for glasses and / or contact lenses ) as well as your eye health. Our examination includes assessment for conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and retinal detachment. Some patients will need to have their pupils dilated to allow for better assessment of these conditions.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">he Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends that adults ( 20-64 years ) have their eyes examined every one to two years. Older adults ( 65 years and older ) should have their eyes examined annually. Some adults may need to have their eyes examined more frequently than this depending on their health, risk factors and medications they take ( e.g. diabetes, family history of glaucoma, etc ). After your initial exam, we can advise you how often you should have your eyes checked based on YOUR particular eye care needs.</p>

        <h2>Child Eye Exams</h2>
        <p>It is important for children to have their eyes examined starting at a young age. The Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends that children have their first eye exam at the age of six ( 6 )months. This may seem young, but it is important to ensure normal ocular health and eye coordination as your young child’s vision is developing. We can assess your child’s ocular health and visual skills such as near vision, distance vision, depth perception, eye movement, peripheral awareness and color vision. Good vision is more than just seeing 20/20!</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">The Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends the following frequency of eye exams for children:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infants and toddlers ( birth to 24 months )- by age 6 months</li>
          <li>Preschool ( 2 to 5 years )- at age 3, and prior to entering elementary school</li>
          <li>School age ( 6 to 19 years )-annually</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Some children have a higher risk of having visual problems, and therefore, may need to be seen more frequently. Some of the factors which may indicate high risk includes premature birth, low birth weight, family history of strabismus ( eye turn ) or amblyopia ( lazy eye ), children with reading and/or learning disabilities.</p>

        <h2>Contact Lens Fitting</h2>
        <p>We use your examination results and additional corneal measurements to select or design a contact lens best suited for your eyes and vision. Conditions such as astigmatism, high refractive error or presbyopia can increase the complexity of the process. After the initial fitting appointment, you will need to return for a follow-up visit to evaluate your vision, comfort and ocular health.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10"><i>Changes to the contact lens design may be required if vision or ocular health is compromised.</i></p>
